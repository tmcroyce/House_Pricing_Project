## Project Overview

For this project, you will use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Business Problem

My chosen stakeholder is a hypothetical real estate firm that specializes in "flipping" homes, which involves the purchase, upgrading, and selling of homes.

The purpose of this project is to provide advice to this real estate firm on what home renovations may increase the values of the homes already owned, and at what prices to purchase and upgrade other homes in King County areas. 

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this assignment's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you **ignore** some or all of the following features:

* `date`
* `view`
* `sqft_above`
* `sqft_basement`
* `yr_renovated`
* `zipcode`
* `lat`
* `long`
* `sqft_living15`
* `sqft_lot15`

### Key Points

* **Your goal in regression modeling is to yield findings to support relevant recommendations. Those findings should include a metric describing overall model performance as well as at least two regression model coefficients.** As you explore the data and refine your stakeholder and business problem definitions, make sure you are also thinking about how a linear regression model adds value to your analysis. "The assignment was to use linear regression" is not an acceptable answer! You can also use additional statistical techniques other than linear regression, so long as you clearly explain why you are using each technique.

* **You should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you must build multiple models. Begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs in the notebook discussing your final model.

* **Data visualization and analysis are no longer explicit project requirements, but they are still very important.** In Phase 1, your project stopped earlier in the CRISP-DM process. Now you are going a step further, to modeling. Data visualization and analysis will help you build better models and tell a better story to your stakeholders.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**
